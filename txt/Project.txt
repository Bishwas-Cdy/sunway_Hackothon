Core Project Framing (for hackathon pitch + implementation)
    Problem: Kathmandu Valley faces frequent flash floods during monsoons due to heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and rapid urbanization. Drivers, commuters, and logistics operators often don’t know which roads will flood until they’re already stuck.
Solution (FloodWatch Kathmandu):
    Predict road-level flood risk ahead of rainfall.
    Alert registered users (email/SMS) when their commute routes are impacted.
    Guide them with safe alternate routes via a web dashboard.

Goal:
    When heavy rainfall happens (forecast or observed), automatically predict which road segments in Kathmandu Valley are likely to flood, then notify registered users whose saved routes or area are affected and provide safe alternatives.

Model objective (conditional prediction)
    Train a model that predicts:
        P(road flooded∣heavy rainfall event at area/time, road features, rainfall intensity)
