Data required for FloodWatch road-level prediction
    The data can be thought of in three buckets:
        A) Static geospatial data (permanent features of Kathmandu roads)
            OSM road network → geometry, road class, surface, lanes, bridges.
            DEM (Digital Elevation Model) → elevation, slope, flow accumulation.
            Rivers/streams layer (OSM or hydro database) → distance to river, floodplain.
            These datasets do not change frequently. They are extracted once and stored as features for every road segment.

        B) Dynamic rainfall data (drives flooding)
            Forecast rainfall (OpenWeatherMap API) → 3-hour steps.
            Historical rainfall reanalysis (NASA GPM IMERG, 2000–present) → for training labels.
            For each heavy-rain event, rainfall data is joined with road features.

        C) Flood outcome data (labels)
            This is the most challenging but critical part. It requires:
                Past flood incident maps/polygons (e.g., Sentinel-1 SAR flood footprints, UNOSAT, ReliefWeb, Cloud-to-Street).
                Reports or road closures (if mapped).
                These are used to label: “This road flooded during this event” (1) versus “not flooded” (0).

Amount of data required
    For a hackathon demo (MVP model):
        3–5 past flood events in Kathmandu can be sufficient (each event = a “training batch”).
        Each event contains thousands of road segments, resulting in ~10k–30k rows.
        This is enough to train a simple logistic regression or XGBoost model that appears convincing.

For a research-grade model:
    Ideally, 20–30 flood events (covering several years of monsoon seasons).
    Each event again produces thousands of road samples → ~100k+ labeled rows.
    This allows proper event-level train/test splits.
    Minimum viable dataset (for Kathmandu use case)
    OSM roads: ~50k segments in the valley.
    DEM: 30m resolution SRTM or 12m Copernicus DEM → clipped to the valley.
    Rivers: OSM river/stream geometries.
    Rainfall forecast: live from OpenWeather (for demo).
    Historical rainfall: NASA IMERG (for training context).
    Flood polygons: at least 3 events (Sentinel-1 SAR, UNOSAT).
    With this dataset, it is possible to:
    Train a lightweight model.
    Run forecasts on live rainfall.
    Show alerts and map risk levels at road scale.

In summary:
    What is needed → Roads, DEM, rivers, rainfall (forecast + historical), and flood outcomes (labels).
    How much is needed → Minimum: 3–5 flood events (~10k labeled road-event rows). Strong model: 20+ events (~100k+ rows).
